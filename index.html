     <h4>Food For Everyone</h4>
    <p>Most of the money (around 60%) from fund will be used to distribute food. We suggest to buy dry food or instant food since there is no chance to cook during flood. Food will be delivered by our volunteers at a specific place. In the case of over flooded area we hire a helicopter for distributing food.</p>
